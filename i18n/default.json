// I'll try to summarize the important things to know:
// If a sentence is too long, it gets split into two dialogue boxes. Putting #$b#
// in a string means 'break here' and will break the text into two dialogue boxes
// so that you can control where it gets split. #$e# in the middle of a string means
// 'end here', meaning that the dialogue will stop at the end point, and if the player
// interacts with the NPC again, the part of the string that follows the end point will
// then be displayed.
// The default portrait that gets shown is the neutral one, or $0, since it's the 0th
// index in the portrait list. To show the index 1 portrait, put $1 at the end of the dialogue
// line. (So before the break/end point, or the end of the string.) Index 2 is $2,
// index 3 is $3, etc. The base expressions also have some non-numeric shorthands -
// the happy portrait is $h, the sad portrait is $s, and the angry portrait is $a.
// (These are typically $1, $2, and $4 respectively - $3 depends on the NPC.)
// If you can put in the break/end points and portrait commands, that would help
// a lot, but if it seems complicated, don't worry about it. Getting the dialogue
// done is the focus.
