//Scene fades the returns with the two talking in the room

Lenny: Haha, it seems like you've made a couple of friends here in the village.

Lenny: You even got that little turtle to let down his guard around you.

*:)*

Lenny: He doesn't seem to trust anyone, besides Yuuma at least. He's a strange little fellow that turtle.

*?*

Lenny: Well, he was here before both me and Lewis. We decided to ask the old mayor about him once, and he said that Torts was here before even him if you can believe it.

Lenny: Nobody was sure when he came to the village, the librarian at the time mentioned that there was records of a turtle from a little after the village was founded. 

Lenny: I guess that must've been one of his relatives huh?

Lenny: One thing is for sure is that is one old turtle Wahaha.
