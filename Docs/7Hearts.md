//Farmer walks in the building while Lenny is there.

Lenny: Oh, hey, @! Can I help you with anything?

*:)*

Lenny: Oh, you're just stopping by? Well, come on in! I could use someone to chat with. Can I get you tea or coffee or anything?

*(Farmer has option to stay and chat with Lenny, or leave.)*

*Music note*

//Scene fades the returns with the two talking in the room

Lenny: Man, I needed a break. I'll tell you, Ridgeside Village may technically be a bureau of Pelican Town, but we've grown so large that sometimes it feels like I should be the mayor and Lewis should be the administrator.

Lenny: No no, I'm just kidding! Kind of. But it is true that our little village has grown a lot these past few years. You may not know this, but we got a lot of newcomers right before you, too. Ian and Sean, Faye, Ysabelle, just to name a few. They all arrived only a year or two before you.

*?*

Lenny: What was it like before? Well, the village was awfully small, I can tell you that much. There were just a few families around, but those who were there had 
been there for generations. Take the Legames, for example. Their family has been running that store for as long as I can remember. It almost shut down when Carlo died-- Thank Yoba Lorenzo came back from Zuzu to run it. He's a good son.

Lenny: Yep, there's the Legames, the Daniels, the Lidens... Oh, wait! There's someone else I'm forgetting. Wanna guess who it is?

*?*

Lenny: No clue? Well, it's Torts!

*!*

Lenny: Yup! That little turtle's been hangin' around here as long as anyone. Our family moved here when I was just a girl and he was already a staple figure. Heck, I even asked the previous mayor about him once, and he said Torts was here before him-- Is that crazy or what? And I asked Gunther to look into it once, and he found records mentioning a turtle already being here around the time the village was founded. I guess that must've been one of his relatives? So maybe he's a generational Ridgeside-ite, too!

*?*

Lenny: Oh, he doesn't belong to anybody, really. I think he's decided to settle down here, like all the rest of us. I like to say he's the town turtle!

Lenny: The kids are all so attached to him, I told them they were his official caretakers. But really he's more than capable of taking care of himself. Although, when Ian came, I asked him to build a little house for him, just because it's so darn cute.

Lenny: One thing is for sure, though-- That is one old turtle! Wahaha
