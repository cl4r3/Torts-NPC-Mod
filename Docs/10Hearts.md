Torts 10 Heart Event Script/Dialogue

//Scene starts with you walking by torts hangout spot, but he is VERY vocal towards you.
Torts: "*Loudly wailing at you*
//Torts then grabs you by the shirt and drags you to his little dog house
//You question him but go inside. You're teleported to the seperate world
Torts: "Welcome @, as you know me in your realm I am but just a tiny tortoise. Here you may gaze upon my true image.
Torts: I have lived for centuries, seen all that this world has to offer. I have seen this valleys beginning as I will see its end.
Torts: During my life I have grown to detest most humans. They are selfish creatures who abuse this earth and take her gifts for granted.
Torts: Although I must admit, I have found myself becoming quite fond of this valley. And you...you have interested me since your arrival. 
Torts: You gave back to the valley and treated it with such respect and compassion. You have done so much to help the people here, listening to their troubles and helping those in need.
Torts: You truly are one of a kind and these are all reasons why I have come to trust you with the information of who I truly am. I hope you will keep it between us *Wink*
Torts: Though this realm is only open right before the seasons change, you will always be welcome here. 
Torts: I would be elevated to converse more with you, if you ever find that you have the time.
Torts: Before you go, I would like to thank you for all that you have done for me and this valley @.`
