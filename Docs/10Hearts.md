Torts 10 Heart Event Script/Dialogue

//Scene starts with you walking by torts hangout spot, but he is VERY vocal towards you.
Torts: "*Loudly wailing at you*
//Torts then grabs you by the shirt and drags you to his little dog house
//You question him but go inside. You're teleported to the seperate world
Torts: "Welcome, @. As you know me in your realm, I am but a tiny tortoise. But in this realm, you may gaze upon my true image.

Torts: I know that you must have a great deal of questions right now. Allow me to provide you with the answers you seek.

Torts: I have lived for many, many years, numbers beyond your comprehension. And throughout these eons, I have seen all that this universe, this galaxy, and your world have to offer. I have seen this valley's beginning just as I will see its end.

Torts: I travel between the planets, manifesting with only a mere shadow of my real power. But in exchange, I can live side by side with each planets' inhabitants. I came to your planet... Well, precisely when, I cannot say, but long before humankind came into existence. And as I watched this species develop, I grew to detest it. Humans are selfish creatures who abuse this planet and take Her gifts for granted without an ounce of remorse.

Torts: ...Or so I thought. I must admit, I have found myself becoming quite fond of this valley that has recently become my home. For the last thousand years, its people have demonstrated kindness and good will I did not think this species was capable of. And you, @....you have caught my eye since the day you first arrived.

Torts: You worked tirelessly to give back to the valley and never ceased to treat it with the utmost respect and compassion. You have done so much to help the people here, listening to their troubles and coming to the aid of those in need.

Torts: You truly are one of a kind. All of this, and more, are the reasons why I have come to trust you with the truth of my identity. I trust in your good discretion to keep this between us. *Wink* //Portrait of Realm!Torts winking?

Torts: Due to the limitations on my power here on your planet, I can only open this portal when the seasons change. 

Torts: I will open the portal without fail when I can, as it is a true joy to converse with you, unencumbered by a corporeal form.

Torts: Once again, I would like to thank you for all that you have done for this valley, @. Your actions mean more than you may ever know.`
