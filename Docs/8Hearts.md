# Torts 8 Heart Event

Setting: The Ridge / Time: Noon - 6 PM / Weather: Sunny / Spirit Realm saved

*Farmer walks up to the pond where Torts is already sitting*

Torts: *Blows bubbles into the water* //Honestly really just liked the image of this lmao

*Farmer does the music note*

*You hear something cry in pain*

*Farmer and Torts do ! emote*

%What was that noise?! It sounds like it came from the forest...

*Torts walks in the direction of the forest, then turns to face the farmer.*

Question: (What should I do?)
- Go investigate.
- **Stay put. (-250)**

*Torts does ... emote*

Torts: *snorts*

*Torts goes into forest. Fade out, end.*

//////////
- **Go investigate.**

*Fade out, cut to Ridge Forest. Fade in as farmer and Torts walk in on monster caught in trap.* //I was thinking something like the serpentine beast or the wilderness golem

*Farmer and Torts do ! emote.*

*Farmer does ... emote, then walks up to the monster and checks on it*

*Monster whimpers*

%The creature seems to be in a lot of pain... It looks like it got caught in some sort of trap.

*Jio and Kiwi enter in a puff of smoke.*

Kiwi: @!

Jio: Hello, @. Are you out monster-hunting as well?

Torts: *stares in turtle*

Jio: Oh, evidently not, if Torts is with you.

*Farmer does ? emote*

Jio: Us? The Seer tasked us with clearing the woods of monsters today. Even though you freed the Spirit Realm from Gabriella's hold, the occasional lost spirit still finds it way here, as you can see.

Jio: Why don't you finish this one off? I must say, I'm quite curious to see the skills of the warrior who saved our realm firsthand.

*Monster whimpers again*

Options: *(No prompt)*
- Do a sick 360 finishing move
- Kill it quickly and painlessly
- **Let the monster go (Jio -50)**
- Tell Jio to kill it himself

*The farmer steps forward and releases the monster from the trap. Jio and Kiwi do ! emote*

Jio: @! What are you doing?! That creature exists solely to harm humans, and you just let it go!$a

*Farmer does ... emote*

Jio: We had it in a trap, and you could have made sure it never did any harm again, but instead you decided to save it? And now you won't even answer why?$a

*Farmer stays silent. Jio turns to face away from farmer.*

Jio: ...Maybe I don't understand you as well as I thought I did, @.

*Jio disappears in puff of smoke.*

*Kiwi looks where Jio left, then turns to face farmer.*

Kiwi: ...$s

Kiwi: ...Kiwi thinks...@ did...kind thing, maybe.$s

*Kiwi does ... emote, then vanishes*

*Fade out, end*

///////////////
- **Do a sick 360 finishing move**

*Kiwi jumps.*

Kiwi: @ go whoosh!!! Mean monster go bleghhh!

Jio: Hmm. A bit flashy, perhaps, but impressive nonetheless.

//////////////
- **Kill it quickly and painlessly (Jio +50)**

Jio: Ah, a true professional, I see. I would expect nothing less.$h

Jio: ...Though Kiwi seems a bit disappointed.$h

Kiwi: Hmph...$s

///////////////
- **Tell Jio to kill it himself (Jio -25)**

Jio: ...What? Well, as you wish.

*Jio kills the monster quickly and painlessly*

/// All three above options unify here ///

Jio: Alright. Kiwi and I will be on our way then. So long.

*Jio disappears in a puff of smoke*

Kiwi: Bye @! Bye Tortle!

*Kiwi disappears in a puff of smoke*
