          # Torts 8 Heart Event
Setting:Torts Pond
Time: 12-6pm
Weather: Clear Skies

Idea 2 (Maybe something like Torts joins you while you run errands in town or like the farm)
//Walking by in town when Torts call to you

Torts: Turt!

//Hit the :) emoji

*You pet Torts on the head*

//Farmer starts walking and Torts just follows 

*?*

*Seems like Torts wants to hangout with you today*

Torts: *Smiles*

//So you keep walking and then montage ensues.

//One of the scenes could be going into Lorenzo's shop

//Another is you dropping off a package to Lenny

//Third scene is you pass by Flor walking in town

//Then you get stopped by Yuuma outside of his house

Yuuma: Hello @. I see Torts is with you today also.

*Music note emote*

Yuuma: It seems the two of you have become very close, especially compared to when you first met Torts.

Torts: Turt!

Yuuma: Torts doesn't seem to care for a lot of people, he seems content being on his own.

Yuuma: I worry about him feeling lonely so I'm glad that he seems to consider you his friend.

*:)*

//Scene ends, maybe another line or two, kinda a very basic rough draft
