          # Torts 8 Heart Event
Setting:Torts Pond
Time: 12-6pm
Weather: Clear Skies

Idea 2 (Maybe something like Torts joins you while you run errands in town or like the farm)
//Walking by in town when Torts call to you

Torts: Tuh-turt!$1

//Hit the :) emoji

*You pet Torts on the head*

//Farmer starts walking and Torts just follows 

*?*

*Seems like Torts wants to hangout with you today...*

Torts: *Smiles*$1

//So you keep walking and then montage ensues.

//One of the scenes could be going into Lorenzo's shop

//Another is you dropping off a package to Lenny

//Third scene is Torts trying to eat Jeric's crops, Jeric catching them and the farmer having to apologize while Torts continues to eat the crops without remorse

Cut back to Torts' doghouse. You're both sitting down outside of it.

Torts does ... emote, scoots closer, scoots closer again, then does <3 emote.

Torts: Tuh-turt!$1

// :3 emote

Fade to black.

*Maybe this little turtle isn't so grumpy after all.*
