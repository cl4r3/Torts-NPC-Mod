# Torts 2 Heart Event
Setting: *Your house*
Time: *6am-8pm* (Leaving your house)
Weather: Clear (Any season could work but honestly Winter may be the best one*

//Part 1: Starts with Trinnie and Keahi coming up to the Farmer at the bus stop
Trinnie: Hi Mr/Mrs @! Sorry to bother you but can you help us with something?
Keahi: Yeah! Do you know what Turtles eat?
*Farmer goes ?*
Trinnie: We wanted to give Torts something to eat but we don't know what they like, so we thought you might.
*Farmer does the accepting emoji the the scene cuts.

//Part 2: Tiny Montage of them trying to feed torts
*Farmer tries to feed him something, I'm thinking just bread*
Torts: *Snorts and turns away*
*...Emoji from everyone*
Keahi: Well he didn't like that. I guess turtles don't like bread.
Trinnie: I have some cookies from earlier, maybe he'd like those? (Walks up to torts to offer them)
Torts: *Shakes his head no*
Trinnie: What about a salad, I've seen him eat leaves before.
//Hand Salaaaad
Torts: *Takes a bite then spits it out*
Keahi: That didn't work either. Maybe we should ask my dad?

//Part 3: Go to Pikas and get food
*The Squad rollin up on the resturaunt, Keahi runs up to Pika*
Keahi: Dad! We need your help! We tried to feed the turtle down at the pond but he didn't like anything we gave him. Can you help us make something for him?
Pika: Hmm...I'm not too sure what they eat, but I'll see what I can do.
//Pikedelli just going to town whipping up dishes
Pika: Here, I remember hearing turtles liked fish, try giving him this soup and let me know if he likes it!
//Hands you 
Keahi: Thanks dad!

//Part 5: Feed Torts and Torts thinks its acceptable
*After hitting the stanky leg they go to torts pond with the Soup*
Trinnie: Here little turtle, try some of this soup!
Torts: *Slurps soup*
Torts: *Thinks for a bit*
Torts: *Nods and walks away*
Keahi: Hey I think he liked it!
Trinnie: Thank you @, he may have been picky but at least we know what he likes now!
Keahi: Yeah, thanks @!

//Scene fades to black maybe? The ending is kinda ass I know.

## Edited version
**Conditions**: Same as above, maybe any season? I agree that winter is best but limiting it to one season can be kind of annoying for the user... We can do winter/non-winter versions as well. I'll show how they'd differ below.

*Farmer leaves farmhouse, where Keahi and Trinnie are waiting on their doorstep.*

Trinnie: Hi Mister/Miss @! Sorry to bother you but can you help us with something?

*//Non-winter version*

  Keahi: Yeah! Can you give us some crops from your farm?

  Trinnie: We're gonna give Torts a yummy healthy snack!

*//Winter version*

  Keahi: Yeah! Can you give us some food from your pantry?

  Trinnie: We're gonna give Torts a nice treat since there isn't any grass to munch on.

*//End of seasonal variation*

Keahi: Yeah! So do you have anything you can give us?

Trinnie: Please? For Torts' sake?

*The kids look at you with wide eyes. Farmer does the whistle emote.*

Keahi: Thanks, mister/miss! Torts is gonna love this for sure!

Trinnie: Do you wanna come with us to see how it goes?

*Farmer has yes/no option. If they select no, the event ends here.*

*Cut to Torts' pond. Trinnie and Keahi are near Torts while the farmer watches from slightly farther back.*

Trinnie: Okay Torts, here you go! Nice yummy leafy greens fresh from %farm farm! *//Winter version:* Some nice pickled vegetables from %farm farm!

*Torts begrudgingly takes a single bite but leaves the rest untouched.*

*Keahi and Trinnie do ! emote*

Keahi: Uh oh, Mister/Miss @, looks like your vegetables are bad.

*Farmer does ... emote. Trinnie turns to face Keahi*

Trinnie: Keahi!! That's not true!!! Alissa says Mister/Miss @'s crops are the best in the valley!

Keahi: Hmm, my dad loves cooking with stuff from %farm farm too... I guess that's not it.

Trinnie: Maybe Torts just doesn't want vegetables?

Keahi: Me too, Torts, me too.

Keahi: Oh oh, I have an idea! I'm gonna grab something from my dad's kitchen, I'll be right back!

*Keahi exits frame. Fade out/in. Keahi re-enters frame.*

Keahi: I'm back!

*Trinne jumps and does ! emote*

Trinnie: Keahi! That's pizza! Turtles can't have pizza!!!

Keahi: Well he didn't want vegetables, and pizza is delicious, so maybe he wants pizza, Trinnie!!

Trinnie: But it's not healthy for him!

Keahi: Just watch! You'll be eating those words when Torts is eating this pizza! Ha!

*Trinnie does angry swirl emote*

Trinnie: Hmph, whatever...

*Keahi tries to give Torts the pizza. He hisses angrily. Keahi does ! emote and leaps backwards. Farmer also does ! emote.*

Trinnie: See? Told you! Stupid Keahi...

*Pika walks in.*

Pika: Oy, Keahi! What were you doing with that pizza? You better not ruin your appetite before dinner, young man!

*Pika pauses and takes in the scene before him, does ... emote*

Pika: What's going on here? Are you feeding the pizza to Shoto's boy's turtle?

Keahi: We're trying to give him a treat! But it's hard, he's really picky, dad!

Trinnie: Hey, Mister Keahi's dad, you're a really good chef, right? Maybe you could make something that he likes?

Pika: Hm... I don't have time to make anything right now, but I have some stuff in the fridge I could give him, I guess.

Keahi: Thanks dad! You're the best!

Trinnie: Hear that, Torts? You're gonna get a meal from Ridgeside's very own superchef Pika!

Pika: Hey, @. I was thinking of heating up some leftover soup I have in the fridge - which of these do you think he'd like?
- Tom Kha Soup
- Trout Soup
- Pumpkin Soup

Pika: Alright, I'll go whip it up!

*Keahi and Trinnie say "Yay!" and "Woohoo!" in speech bubbles over their heads as Pika leaves. Fade out/in. The soup is in front of Torts and everyone is watching anxiously.*

Pika: Alright kids, the moment of truth!

Trinnie: C'mon, Torts! Come try some!

Keahi: My dad made it so it'll be super good, I promise!

*Torts slowly approaches the bowl and takes a sip, does ... emote. If the player chose Tom Kha soup, he will then do the :3 emote. Regardless of choice, he will then continue to drink.*

Keahi: Hey! He's actually eating it!

Trinnie: Hurray! We finally found something he doesn't hate! *//For Tom Kha soup:* Yeah! It seems like he actually kinda likes it!

Keahi: We did it! Thanks, dad!

Pika: Haha, anything for you, you crazy kids.

*Keahi and Trinnie do their happy dance animations. Torts continues eating.*

Torts: *happy turtle noises*

*Farmer does :3 emote. The end.*
