Setting: Ridgeside Falls / Time: 4pm-6pm / Weather: Any

//Walk in the club and notice Torts is flipped upside down

*Farmer does ! emote, walks a bit closer*

Torts: *Struggles*

Torts: *More struggling*

Torts: *Struggling intensifies*

Question box: (What should I do?)

- **Ask Torts what happened.**

- Flip Torts over.

- Wait to see if he flips over on his own.

*Farmer does ? emote*

%Torts doesn't respond, because he is a tortoise, and thus incapable of higher-level language.

*Question repeats without first option.*

- **Flip Torts over. (+25)**

*Farmer walks over and flips Torts.*

// OR //

- **Wait to see if he flips over on his own. (-100)**

*Torts struggles some more, then rights himself.*

// The two routes unify from here. //

Torts: ...

*Torts suddenly runs away*

*Farmer does ! emote and turns to face the direction he leaves in*

*Fade out*

%How did Torts end up all the way out here...?
