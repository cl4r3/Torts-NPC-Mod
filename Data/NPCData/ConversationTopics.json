	// Conversation Topics are dialogue keys that characters will use after a given event.
	// For example, after Keahi's two-heart event, the town receives the 'keahi_prank' conversation topic,
	// where they all talk about how the farmer smells. 
	// Note: Making a single character have a specific line of dialogue after an event can be done in the event code
	// itself and does not need a conversation topic.
