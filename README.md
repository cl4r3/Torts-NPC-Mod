# Torts-NPC-Mod
Stardew Valley mod by moetrash and Orthorn to make Torts from Rafseazz's Ridgeside Village into a full-fledged NPC.

Name: Torts (AKA Tortolla Von Torts)

General Ideas

- Torts seems to be somewhat of an enigma, there are records of him dating back to when the meteor fell and the valley
was created. No one seems to know that, the dwarf/krobus/the spirits all recall feeling like they saw him before but
think maybe its a relative of his. Theres no way a tortoise can live that long right. I want to imagine Torts backstory
is all pretty much a mystery and he won't tell anyone where he comes from. I also want this overlapping mystery to be 
throughout the whole game with very tiny hints.

-Torts can be brought to the movies, only loved movie is Wumbus, loved snack is stardrop sorbet. Likes only
Apple slices and Panzanella Salad(Not human food)

- Personality wise we could make torts very classy or like a wise old man lol

Friending Torts
- Torts can be friended from the start but is extremely hard to friend. Hates/Dislikes 90% of items from the game.
(Giving torts bad items can have bad effects, bad luck, friendship goes down for town, animals less happy)
- Neutrals: All the soups
(Higher chance for meteorite?)
- Likes: Certain relics maybe(maybe to easy)? Fairy Dust, Strange Bun, Bone flute, Star Shards
(Could make it rain, animals/villagers more happy)
- Loves: All loved besides rabbits foot and pearl, dino egg, radioactive bar, ancient fruit
(chance of fairy, same as liked but higher change)

- Doesn't show any side of being weird besides at his 10 hearts, all other hints come from outside sources. 

- His 10 heart event can be unlocked after finding the secret note tied to him saying he's a wack ass turtle. Also
must have finished the spirit realm event and be able to have befriended Undreya.  

Festivals:
Torts should be in the RSV festivals just hanging out but idk about the Pelican Town ones, we could say Keahi brought
him to the events or hes just there unexplainably which would be funny, and for him to not be affected by the Luau +friendship.

Tort Events (Just ideas for now not set in stone):

- 0 Hearts (enter the Ridge): Keahi and Trinnie introduce you to Torts, he doesn't seem to give you the time of day. Doesn't care for the farmer
at all.

- 2 Hearts: Keahi and Trinnie are trying to feed him but he doesn't want to eat any human food they give him, until he accepts the
soup

- 4 Hearts: (You notice Torts is angry, after investigating you see there is litter in his pond, you help him)

- 6 Hearts: Torts is found stuck (maybe flipped upside down) somewhere it wouldn't make sense for him to be, maybe the ridge mountain
or the hiking trail. (Pelican Town Cable Car Stop?)

- 8 Hearts: Torts has seemed to have warmed up to you a lot and yknow, shows turtle affection. 

- 10 Hearts: Torts bites the farmer's sleeve and drags them into his doghouse. Entering the doghouse teleports them to Torts' Realm, where Torts is actually a giant tortoise figure who dwarfs the farmer in size. Torts reveals his true identity and explains his existence to the farmer. From then on, the farmer can visit Torts' Realm on the 28th of each month.

Art needed:
- Basic emotion portraits (happy, sad, angry)
- 6 heart event art: Flipped Torts portrait and sprites
- 10 heart event art: Torts grabbing sleeve, Torts' true form, Torts' Realm map
- Torts in sunglasses
- Torts Halloween costume

1.5 Update

-Big Central Idea is Island Mountain Turtle
-Maybe a offshoot Island from Ginger Island
-Its like a hidden land for the special turtles/maybe some of the dinos seen in the caverns
