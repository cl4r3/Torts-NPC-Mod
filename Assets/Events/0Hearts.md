# Torts 0 Heart Event
(Here's an example of what a script could go like. Obviously, feel free to change it however you like.)

**Setting:** Ridgeside Village / **Time:** 12-4 PM, Saturday or Sunday / **Weather:** Sunny

*The farmer enters the village from the Cliff. Trinnie and Keahi are standing by the town map. (So same area where Keahi's 2 heart even takes place.)*

Keahi: Hi farmer @!

*Farmer does ? emote.*

*Trinnie moves forward one space, does music note emote.*

Trinnie: Guess what we found!

And so on...
Here's the event data wiki page, so you can see all the stuff that's possible to do during events: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data
Some important stuff to note is that you can change locations, both within maps and to other maps. Like in this example event, we could change from the entrance to the village to Torts' doghouse.
