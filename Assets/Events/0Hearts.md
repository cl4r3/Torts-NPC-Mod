# Torts 0 Heart Event
(Here's an example of what a script could go like. Obviously, feel free to change it however you like.)

**Setting:** Ridgeside Village / **Time:** 12-4 PM, Saturday or Sunday / **Weather:** Sunny

*Yuuma is leaving his house as the farmer passes.*

Yuuma: Ah, hello @.

*Farmer does the normal smiley response emote.*

*...from the ol yuuma, then it turns to the !*

Yuuma: Um...are you busy right now? Theres something I would like to show you.

*Music note emote*

*Scene cuts and youre at torts pond with torts*

Yuuma: @, I would like you to meet Torts.

%Torts stares at you for a second then turns away and returns to his business

Yuuma: Apparently he's been here for a long time, Miss Lenny said he has been here since before she arrived.

*! coming from the farmer*

Yuuma: He doesn't seem to care much for most people, but I still don't want him to be lonely.

Yuuma: Hopefully you can become his friend also!

*Happy emotion then end the scene*



# Alternate Version: Yuuma, Shiro, and Philip / Same conditions as above, maybe not winter?

*Yuuma is playing with Torts outside his house. Shiro and Philip are watching.*

*The farmer walks into the scene down the stairs south of Jeric's farm (or potentially the path south of Torts' pond, depending on which fits into frame better) when Philip spots them.

Philip: Hello there, sir/ma'am!

Shiro: Oh, hi, @! Beautiful day, huh?

Shiro: Do you want to join us for a bit? If you're not busy, of course.

*Farmer does whistle emote and comes over to stand next to Philip and Shiro. They watch Yuuma and Torts play for a bit.*

Shiro: *whispers* Hey, would you mind trying to play with Yuuma a bit? He can be a bit shy, but I think it'd mean a lot to him to have someone else join.

*Farmer does :3 emote and goes to join Yuuma.*

Yuuma: ...Hello.

*Farmer does :3 emote again. Yuuma does ... emote. There's an awkward pause.*

Shiro: Yuuma, why don't you introduce @ to your friend?

*Farmer does ? emote*

Yuuma: ...Okay.

Yuuma: Um... This guy is named Torts. He's a Calico Ridgeback Tortoise and he eats mostly leaves and fruits. He used to live in a terrarium in the Village Office but now Miss Lenny is letting me take care of him. She says he's so old that he was in the office when she got there. Did you know some species of giant tortoises can live to be over a hundred years old in the wild, and nearly two hundred years old in captivity?

Torts: *stares at you*

Yuuma: Torts isn't a giant tortoise though, so I don't think he's that old. But I think he's at least older than my parents. Definitely older than Shiro.

Shiro: ...Why does that feel like an insult?

*Philip laughs*

*Torts comes closer to the farmer and stares at them even more intently, then suddenly retreats into his shell. Farmer does ! emote.*

Yuuma: There, there, Torts.

Yuuma: Don't be offended. Torts can be a bit distrustful around strangers. But just give him time.

Yuuma: Well, a lot of time. He is a tortoise, after all.

*Farmer laughs. Yuuma does ? emote. The end*
