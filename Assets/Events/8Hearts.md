# Torts 8 Heart Event
Setting:Torts Pond
Time: 12-6pm
Weather: Clear Skies

Idea 1 (Kinda a short and basic one but we could add more or do something else which I think we may have to do)
//Starts with you rolling up on the pond, yuuma and torts are there playing with a ball
*Yuuma rolls the ball to Torts and notices you, ! and walks up to you
Yuuma: Hi Mr.@. How are you today?
*The ol one two :) emoji*
*While you guys do that Torts walks up to you and nudges the ball at you*
Tort: *Turt!*
Yuuma: Wow, it seems like Torts has really warmed up to you. 
*hit em with the old musical note*
Yuuma: I'm glad he's found someone else he likes, Torts doesn't interested in many others.
Yuuma: I think he just doesn't trust people, I wonder why though?
*? emoji*
*Scene ends with more ball playing

Idea 2 (Maybe something like Torts joins you while you run errands in town or like the farm)
