# Torts 2 Heart Event
Setting: *Your house*
Time: *6am-8pm* (Leaving your house)
Weather: Clear (Any season could work but honestly Winter may be the best one*

//Part 1: Starts with Trinnie and Keahi coming to the farmers door
Trinnie: Hi Mr/Mrs @! Sorry to bother you but can you help us with something?
Keahi: Yeah! Do you know what Turtles eat?
*Farmer goes ?*
Trinnie: We wanted to give Torts something to eat but we don't know what they like, so we thought you might.
*Farmer does the accepting emoji the the scene cuts.

//Part 2: Tiny Montage of them trying to feed torts
*Farmer tries to feed him something, I'm thinking just bread*
Torts: *Snorts and turns away*
*...Emoji from everyone*
Keahi: Well he didn't like that. I guess turtles don't like bread.
Trinnie: I have some cookies from earlier, maybe he'd like those? (Walks up to torts to offer them)
Torts: *Shakes his head no*
Trinnie: What about a salad, I've seen him eat leaves before.
//Hand Salaaaad
Torts: *Takes a bite then spits it out*
Keahi: That didn't work either. Maybe we should ask my dad?

//Part 3: Go to Pikas and get food
*The Squad rollin up on the resturaunt, Keahi runs up to Pika*
Keahi: Dad! We need your help! We tried to feed the turtle down at the pond but he didn't like anything we gave him. Can you help us make something for him?
Pika: Hmm...I'm not too sure what they eat, but I'll see what I can do.
//Pikedelli just going to town whipping up dishes
Pika: Here, I remember hearing turtles liked fish, try giving him this soup and let me know if he likes it!
//Hands you 
Keahi: Thanks dad!

//Part 5: Feed Torts and Torts thinks its acceptable
*After hitting the stanky leg they go to torts pond with the Soup*
Trinnie: Here little turtle, try some of this soup!
Torts: *Slurps soup*
Torts: *Thinks for a bit*
Torts: *Nods and walks away*
Keahi: Hey I think he liked it!
Trinnie: Thank you @, he may have been picky but at least we know what he likes now!
Keahi: Yeah, thanks @!

//Scene fades to black maybe? The ending is kinda ass I know.
